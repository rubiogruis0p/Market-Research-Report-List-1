<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Editing Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In Vivo Gene Editing</li><li>In Vitro Gene Editing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gene editing therapy market comprises two primary types: in vivo and in vitro gene editing. In vivo gene editing involves directly modifying genes within a living organism, targeting specific tissues or cells to treat genetic disorders. Conversely, in vitro gene editing occurs outside the organism, typically in a laboratory setting, where genetic material is altered before being introduced back into the body. Both methods offer innovative approaches to treating various diseases and genetic conditions through precise genetic modifications.</p></p>
