<p><ul><li>Canister Based Airbag</li><li>Fan Based Airbag</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The avalanche airbag pack market consists of two main types: canister-based airbags and fan-based airbags. Canister-based airbags use a compressed gas canister to inflate the airbag rapidly upon activation, providing essential buoyancy during an avalanche. In contrast, fan-based airbags rely on a battery-powered fan to continuously draw in air, creating a larger airbag over time.
